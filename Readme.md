# GMu

**GMu** is a Game Boy emulator. The goal of this project was to teach myself a little bit about computer architecture, and low level programming.

This is my first programming project, so keep that in mind.

## Build
WIP

## TODO
- Need to re-write UI, currently uses SDL. It's also a mess!!
- Need to implement STOP opcode, currently resets the system.
- Clean up the code, lots of inconsistencies.
- Fully add support for MBC1, MBC2, MBC3, and MBC5.
- Add Win32, and Cocoa support for UI.
