# GMu

**GMu** is a Game Boy emulator. The goal of this project was to teach myself a little bit about computer architecture, and low-level programming.

This is my first programming project, so keep that in mind.

## Build
WIP

## TODO
- Currently working on the win32_native branch of this project. Once that is finished I will come back to the SDL version!
