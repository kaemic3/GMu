#+title: Input

* TODO
+ Fix input so the joypad buttons are working (right now the action keys act as direction keys and vice versa)
  - Create 2 registers for input, one for direction, and one for action.
+ Change input so it uses key held instead of key pressed.
  - This way the input will not be read in incorrectly. I can forsee a case where the emulator this 2 buttons are pressed at the same time when they are not due to the way the current system works.
