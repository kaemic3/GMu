#+title: ppu

* Done:
+ BG rendering
+ Some vertical scrolling
+ PPU output to the screen via SDL

* Need to do:
+ Add window detection
+ Add sprite fifo
+ Add buffer that will combine pixel data from the BG/Win fifo and the sprite fifo, which is then sent to the screen

** Window tiles
The BG/Win FIFO needs to choose between the BG and Win tilemaps depending on LCDC register
