#+title: ppu

* Done:
+ BG rendering
+ Some vertical scrolling
+ PPU output to the screen via SDL
+ BG/Win fifo and output

* Need to do:
+ Sprite fifo and output

* Sprite output:

** Merging FG and BG fifos
 * Need:
   - Need to make sure that sprite pixels without priority over the BG fifo are pushed accordingly.
     * Should check:https://gbdev.io/pandocs/OAM.html, bottom of the page as it goes over how this works. Probably need to look at this closer after implementing the interrupts.
   - UPDATE COMMENTS!!!!!
