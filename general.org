#+title: General

* Need to:
+ Fix all 16 bit add functions (all are incorrect ATM).
  - Based on blargg test roms
+ Need to fix opcodes:
  - CCF op: 0x3f
  - ADC ops: 0x88, 0x89, 0x8a, 0x8b, 0x8c, 0x8d, 0x8f, 0xCE, 0x8e
  - SBC ops: 0x98, 0x99, 0x9a, 0x9b, 0x9c, 0x9d, 0xDE, 0x9e
** TODO Implement MBC1
- Figured out that the stat.ly_lyc_flag bit was not getting reset and was causing stat interrupt to occur constantly. Now we get stuck at pc=0x296, then crash.
- Currently the issue seems to be with the stat interrupt source.
- Found that the screen is turned off at $576
- Looks like as soon as the screen is turned off, the STAT interrupt is fired.
- No longer crashing, but still have weird issues.
- Look at debug output to see what to do next.
- VBlank seems to init a DMA.
** DONE Fix CPU
** TODO UI Re-Work
** TODO Fix "state issues" with encapsulation
- Need to do UI re-work for this to happen
** DONE PPU Re-work
