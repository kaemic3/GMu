#+title: General

* Need to:
+ Fix all 16 bit add functions (all are incorrect ATM).
  - Based on blargg test roms
+ Need to fix opcodes:
  - CCF op: 0x3f
  - ADC ops: 0x88, 0x89, 0x8a, 0x8b, 0x8c, 0x8d, 0x8f, 0xCE, 0x8e
  - SBC ops: 0x98, 0x99, 0x9a, 0x9b, 0x9c, 0x9d, 0xDE, 0x9e
* DMA Needs:
+ Need to load from the specified addess in the DMA registerm into OAM
  - Can:
    + Copy all at once
    + Copy one byte every 4 cpu clocks -> This may be the most accurate way to do it since DMA lasts for 160 machine cycles. This is one machine cycle per byte copied from RAM to OAM
