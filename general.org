#+title: General

* Need to:
+ Fix all 16 bit add functions (all are incorrect ATM).
  - Based on blargg test roms
+ Need to fix opcodes:
  - CCF op: 0x3f
  - ADC ops: 0x88, 0x89, 0x8a, 0x8b, 0x8c, 0x8d, 0x8f, 0xCE, 0x8e
  - SBC ops: 0x98, 0x99, 0x9a, 0x9b, 0x9c, 0x9d, 0xDE, 0x9e
** Need to redo the PPU
+ There are bugs with the bg and sprites
+ Check and Dr. Mario uses bg tiles on the main menu where there are black boxes. There are also issues with the text areas not rendering properly.
  - This is possibly due to using signed addressing mode. Maybe look into this before the re-write.
** Dr. Mario is crashing on startup of the game. Need to see why. Check $260 - $267
+ After some debugging, it seems that the screen is not turning back on when it should be. That is why the emulator is hanging. Need to investigate further.
